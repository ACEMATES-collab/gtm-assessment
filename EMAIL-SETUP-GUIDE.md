## üö® Troubleshooting Email Issues

### Emails Not Being Received:

1. **Check Spam Folder**
   - Look in spam/junk for both admin and candidate

2. **Verify Domain in Resend**
   - Go to Resend dashboard
   - Check "Domains" section
   - Status should be "Verified"

3. **Check Resend Logs**
   - Go to "Logs" in Resend dashboard
   - Look for failed deliveries
   - Check error messages

4. **Verify API Key**
   - In Vercel environment variables
   - Make sure no spaces before/after key
   - Key should start with `re_`

5. **Test Email Manually**
   - Use Resend dashboard to send test email
   - Confirms your domain setup is correct

### Email Formatting Issues:

1. **Preview in Browser**
   - Copy HTML from email
   - Open in browser to see formatting

2. **Test with Different Email Clients**
   - Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail all render differently
   - Use Litmus or Email on Acid for testing

### Deployment Issues:

   - Check Vercel project settings
   - Redeploy after adding variable

2. **API Route Not Working**
   - Check Vercel function logs

   - Avoid generic addresses (@gmail.com)

3. **Email Content**
   - Avoid spam trigger words
   - Include unsubscribe option (if bulk)
   - Keep HTML clean and valid

4. **Sender Reputation**
   - Start with low volume
   - Gradually increase sending
   - Monitor bounce rates

## üí∞ Cost Comparison

| Service | Free Tier | Paid Plans |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Resend** | 3,000/month | $20/mo (50k) |

   - Add rate limiting if needed

3. **Monitor Usage**

   - Set up usage alerts
   - Watch for unusual activity

- Resend free tier works perfectly
- Consider upgrading if approaching limit

**For > 3,000 assessments/month:**
